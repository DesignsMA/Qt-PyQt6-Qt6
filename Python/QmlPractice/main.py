# Signals and slots
# Common toolkits used in the creation of user interfaces use
# Callbacks, a callback is a pointer to a function, there is a processing function
# that calls the callback (another function) when appropiate (event)
# However, qt uses an alternative to the callback technique
# A signal is emmited when an object changes its internal state in a way that is
# interesting to the object's client or owner,
# When a signal is emmited the slots connected to it are called in order of connection
# Slots are common python  or c++ functions that have the particularity of being 
# connected to signal

#Slot() decorator is used to explicitly mark a Python method as a Qt slot
#@Slot(str, result=str) 
#@Slot(str)
#Declares that the slot accepts a string argument (the signal must emit a str).
#result=str
#Specifies that the slot returns a string (useful when connecting to signals that expect a return value).
